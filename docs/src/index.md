# Recommendation.jl

**Recommendation.jl** is a Julia package for building recommender systems. Thanks to independent *data accessor* and *recommender* implementations, this package enables you to build recommendation systems on your own data and algorithms.

For more information, you can refer to [my article](http://takuti.me/note/recommendation-julia/).
